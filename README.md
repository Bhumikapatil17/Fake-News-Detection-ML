Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The system classifies news as **Fake** or **Real** based on textual content.

🎯 Problem Statement
The rapid spread of fake news through social media and online platforms can mislead people and create serious social issues.  
This project aims to build an accurate fake news detection system using supervised machine learning techniques.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files:
- **Fake.csv** – Contains fake news articles
- **True.csv** – Contains real news articles

Both datasets are labeled and combined to train and evaluate the model.

⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Text preprocessing using NLP techniques
- Stopword removal and cleaning
- TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
- Logistic Regression for classification

📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 98.84%
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score are approximately **0.99** for both Fake and Real news classes

🧪 Custom Testing
The model supports custom user input to predict whether a news article is fake or real.

**Sample Output:**
FAKE NEWS 🔴

 ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `FakeNewsDetection.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Enter custom news text to get predictions

🚀 Future Scope
- Real-time fake news detection system
